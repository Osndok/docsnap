*docsnap* is intended to be a cog in a larger document scanning workflow. At the moment, it is little
more than a kludgy hack against the "camorama" source (to which it is a derivative work / forked project).

These are it's primary features / goals:
* to provide a "view finder" window that gives a sense of the image to be captured,
* to capture an image at the full/native resolution of the camera,
* to not re-initialize the underlying device during preview or capture (as this greatly bothers the focus on my Ziggi HD-Plus document camera)
* to be usable as a subprogram for image capture by:
** allowing local programs to signal a capture event via a *USR1* process signal
** printing all captured images to *STDOUT* so the wrapping process knows where to get the product.

In particular, it is not (and should never become) a full scanning interface, though it may ultimately
become the upstream for such projects and is not against making such expansions easier for downstream
projects (I already have one in mind, actually).

Cheers.
